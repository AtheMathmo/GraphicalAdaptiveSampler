#Graphical Adaptive Sampler

This project is (going to be) a combination of discrete belief propagation and adaptive rejection sampling.

I plan to implement belief propagation on tree Factor Graphs for discrete distributions. And then using adaptive rejection sampling apply this to simple (univariate) continuous distributions.

This is a work in progress.

## Currently Implemented

- Adaptive Rejection Sampling
